Documenting proof of circ-in-circ
Source : M. B. Raj Whatsapp Video
Statement : Locus of a point on the surface of a circle rolling (without slipping) on the inner surface of a larger circle is a straight line through origin
Steps :
	1. Frame the video into statement
	2. \omega_{CO} = \omega_{PC}i
		2.1. Figure with \vec{r} vectors and no slip (\vec(V_{PC})=\vec{V{CO}})
	3. Locus equation in (r, \theta
Auxiliary:
	1, Animation maybe in python (Shouldn't be too hard)

Why? ............................ Why not?
